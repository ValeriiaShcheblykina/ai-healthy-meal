# Application – HealthyMeal (MVP)

### Main Problem

Adjusting online recipes to personal dietary needs and requirements is difficult. The application uses AI and user preferences to propose tailored recipes.

### Minimum Feature Set

- Saving, reading, browsing, and deleting recipes in text form
- A simple user account system to associate users with their own recipes
- A user profile page for storing dietary preferences
- AI integration that allows modifying recipes according to the user’s dietary requirements

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Importing recipes from a URL
- Rich multimedia support (e.g., recipe photos)
- Sharing recipes with other users
- Social features

### Success Criteria

- 90% of users have completed the dietary preferences section in their profile
- 75% of users generate one or more recipes per week
