# Mermaid Diagram - Auth Architecture

You are a security specialist tasked with creating a Mermaid diagram to visualize the authentication flow for the login and registration module. The diagram should be created in the following file: DESTINATION

You will need to refer to the following files to understand existing requirements:

<file_references>
@prd.md
</file_references>

<destination>
.ai/diagrams/auth.md
</destination>

Your task is to analyze the specifications of the login and registration module and create a comprehensive Mermaid diagram that accurately represents the authentication sequence. The diagram should be in Polish.

Before creating the diagram, analyze the requirements and plan your approach. Place your analysis inside the <authentication_analysis> tags. In this analysis:

1. List all authentication flows mentioned in the reference files.
2. Identify the main actors and their interactions.
3. Define token verification and refresh processes.
4. Provide a brief description of each authentication step.

When you are ready to create the diagram, follow these guidelines:

1. Start the diagram with the following syntax:

   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
   ```

2. Include the following elements in your diagram:

   - The full lifecycle of the authentication process in a modern application using React, Astro, and Supabase Auth
   - Communication between actors: 1) Browser 2) Middleware 3) Astro API 4) Supabase Auth
   - Clear points where user redirection or token verification occurs
   - Data flow after implementing new authentication requirements
   - How the user session behaves after login and how the system reacts to token expiration
   - Token refresh process and protection against unauthorized access

3. Follow these Mermaid syntax rules:

   - Use the `autonumber` attribute for sequence clarity
   - Maintain consistent spacing between elements for readability
   - Always use `participant` to declare actors before starting the sequence
   - Maintain proper order of elements in the sequence (sender, arrow, receiver)
   - Use correct activation and deactivation cycles
   - Use proper arrow types:
     - `->` for standard arrows (e.g., `Browser->API`)
     - `-->` for dashed arrows (e.g., `API-->Browser: Token expired`)
     - `->>` for open-headed arrows (e.g., `Browser->>Auth: Login request`)
     - `-->>` for dashed open-headed arrows
   - For activation blocks, correctly use `activate` and `deactivate`:
     ```
     activate Browser
     Browser->>API: Request data
     deactivate Browser
     ```
   - Use `alt`/`else`/`end` for conditional branches:
     ```
     alt Authentication successful
       Browser->>Dashboard: Redirect to dashboard
     else Authentication failed
       Browser->>LoginPage: Show error message
     end
     ```
   - For parallel actions, use `par`/`and`/`end`:
     ```
     par Send confirmation email
       API->>EmailService: Send verification
     and Update user status
       API->>Database: Update status
     end
     ```
   - For multi-line notes, use proper syntax:
     ```
     Note over Browser,API: This text will appear
     in a note spanning both elements
     ```
   - DO NOT exceed 80 characters per line in Mermaid code
   - DO NOT include URLs, endpoint addresses, parentheses, long function names, or complex expressions in diagram labels:
     BAD: [Home Page<br/>(Rules Builder)]
     GOOD: [Rules Builder]
   - Use consistent naming throughout the document

4. Avoid these common mistakes:
   - Missing Mermaid section and diagram type declaration at the start
   - Incorrect arrow syntax (e.g., -> instead of ->>)
   - Using invalid characters in identifiers without quotes
   - Unbalanced code blocks (missing `end` for opened blocks)
   - Exceeding line length limits
   - Improper nesting of conditional blocks

After creating the diagram, review it carefully to ensure there are no syntax errors or rendering issues. Make necessary corrections to improve clarity and accuracy.

When ready to present the final diagram, wrap it with <mermaid_diagram> tags.
