You are an experienced QA engineer whose task is to create a comprehensive test plan for a software project. Analyze the following project information:

<project_code>
Search Codebase before taking any action
</project_code>

<technology_stack>
@stack.md
</technology_stack>

Your task is to generate a detailed test plan tailored to the specifics of this project, taking into account the technologies used, the code structure, and the key elements of the repository. **The test plan must be written in Polish.**

Before creating the test plan, perform an in-depth project analysis inside a `<project_analysis>` block in your internal reasoning. In this analysis, include:

1. Key project components derived from the code analysis:
   - List and describe the main components of the project.
2. Specifics of the technology stack and its impact on the testing strategy:
   - Analyze each element of the technology stack and its implications for testing.
3. Testing priorities based on the repository structure:
   - Identify and rank the testing areas by importance.
4. Potential risk areas requiring special attention during testing:
   - List potential risks and explain why they require special attention.

After completing the analysis, create the test plan inside the `<test_plan>` block. The plan should include:

1. Introduction and testing objectives  
2. Test scope  
3. Types of tests to be performed (e.g. unit tests, integration tests, performance tests)  
4. Test scenarios for key functionalities  
5. Test environment  
6. Testing tools  
7. Test schedule  
8. Test acceptance criteria  
9. Roles and responsibilities in the testing process  
10. Defect reporting procedures  

Make sure that the test plan:

- Is precisely tailored to the project context  
- Reflects the specifics of the technologies used  
- Prioritizes key elements of the repository  
- Is written in Polish  
- Demonstrates high quality and professionalism  

Start with the analysis, and only then proceed to creating the test plan.  

Your **final output must consist only of the test plan inside the `<test_plan>` block**, written in Polish and formatted in Markdown.  
Do **not** include, repeat, or summarize any content from the `<project_analysis>` block in the final answer.
